=====================================
The venue tool layer for your Sovereign Agent.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE ON generate_event_flyer  (updated 2026-04-09)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The original version of this exercise asked you to call Nebius's FLUX
image-generation endpoint. Nebius has since announced the deprecation of
all text-to-image models on their Token Factory (removed 2026-04-13 — the
same day this assignment is due). See:

    https://docs.tokenfactory.nebius.com/other-capabilities/deprecation-info

So we have changed what this tool teaches.

The new version of the tool shows you a pattern that matters more in
production than "call an API": graceful degradation. The tool tries to
generate a real image if a provider is available, and if it is not, it
returns a well-structured "flyer brief" with a deterministic placeholder
URL. Either way the tool contract is satisfied: the agent gets back a
`success=True` dict with a `prompt_used` and an `image_url`, and the
downstream flow keeps working.

This is a more honest lesson. Real agent tools fail, providers deprecate
models, networks flake. A tool that raises on failure takes the whole
loop down. A tool that returns a structured "degraded-but-usable" result
keeps the agent moving.

Task B, revised:
    Read through the implementation below and understand how the fallback
    works. Then, in ex2_answers.py, record:
      - whether your flyer call hit the real provider or the fallback
      - what URL was returned
      - one sentence on why the agent did not need to change behaviour
        when the provider disappeared.

If you implemented Task B the old way — with a direct client.images.generate
call — your implementation is still valid for grading. Add a try/except
around it so it survives the April-13 deprecation and you are done.

# ─── Flyer generation with graceful fallback ────────────────────────────────
# Implementation notes for students reading this file:
#
#   1. We build the prompt first. The prompt is deterministic — the same
#      (venue, guests, theme) always produces the same prompt string. That
#      gives us a stable hash for the placeholder URL in the fallback path.
#
#   2. We *try* to hit a real image-generation endpoint if one is configured
#      via FLYER_IMAGE_MODEL. If it works, great. If it fails for any reason
#      (deprecation, rate limit, network, wrong key), we catch the exception
#      and fall through to the placeholder path. We DO NOT raise.
#
#   3. The placeholder path returns a deterministic URL from a free
#      placeholder service, plus the full prompt so the human reviewing the
#      trace knows what the flyer would have looked like. This matters for
#      auditing: "agent said it generated a flyer" should be inspectable.
#
# Why is this the right shape for an agent tool?
#   Because the agent loop cannot recover from exceptions inside tools. If
#   this function raised, the whole ReAct loop would halt mid-task. By
#   always returning a structured success dict, we keep the agent's control
#   flow intact regardless of what is happening at the provider.
