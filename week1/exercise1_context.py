Exercise 1 — Context Engineering Benchmark
===========================================

WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND WHY
----------------------------
Before building agents, you need to understand a property of language models
that affects every agent you will ever write: the model's ability to extract
the correct answer from a prompt depends partly on WHERE information appears
and HOW it is formatted — not just WHAT information is present.

This is not a small effect. Research from Stanford (Liu et al., 2023) showed
that GPT-3.5 performed *below its closed-book baseline* when the answer was
buried in the middle of a long context. The model was more accurate with no
documents at all than with the answer hidden in the centre of a long prompt.

This exercise tests that claim on your own machine, with the Edinburgh data.

WHAT YOU WILL DO
-----------------
Part A: Three presentation conditions (plain / XML / sandwich) on a clean dataset.
        You will record which conditions the model gets right and which it gets wrong.

Part B: Add near-miss distractors to lower the signal-to-noise ratio.
        The distractors are designed to look almost correct.

Part C: If Parts A and B showed no failures, switch to a much smaller model
        (Gemma 2 2B) to find where format starts to matter.
        (Part C runs automatically if needed — you don't choose.)

THE HONEST CAVEAT
------------------
Strong frontier models on short, clean datasets sometimes get all three
conditions correct. That is not a failure of the experiment — it is data.
It tells you the signal-to-noise ratio is high enough that structural help
isn't needed here. Part B and Part C are designed to lower that ratio until
the effect appears, so you see it in practice, not just in lecture slides.

MODEL CHOICES  (updated 2026-04-13)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MAIN_MODEL:  meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct  (Base variant)
    The Base variant of Llama 3.3 70B survives the April-13 Nebius
    deprecation round. Only the `_fast` variant was removed. If you see
    documentation mentioning "Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-fast" anywhere, that
    is the deprecated one — this file uses the Base variant, which is
    stable.

SMALL_MODEL: google/gemma-2-2b-it
    The earlier version of this file used `Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct` as
    the small stress-test model. Both variants of that model (Base and
    Fast) were deprecated on 2026-04-13, so we migrated to Gemma 2 2B,
    which is smaller, cheaper, and arguably a better pedagogical fit:
    the effect you are hunting for (structural formatting changing the
    answer) is MORE visible on a weaker model, not less. If Parts A and
    B pass cleanly on the 70B and you need to see failure conditions,
    a 2B model reaches them faster than an 8B.
