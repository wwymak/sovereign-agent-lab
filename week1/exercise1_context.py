Exercise 1 — Context Engineering Benchmark
===========================================

WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND WHY
----------------------------
Before building agents, you need to understand a property of language models
that affects every agent you will ever write: the model's ability to extract
the correct answer from a prompt depends partly on WHERE information appears
and HOW it is formatted — not just WHAT information is present.

This is not a small effect. Research from Stanford (Liu et al., 2023) showed
that GPT-3.5 performed *below its closed-book baseline* when the answer was
buried in the middle of a long context. The model was more accurate with no
documents at all than with the answer hidden in the centre of a long prompt.

This exercise tests that claim on your own machine, with the Edinburgh data.

WHAT YOU WILL DO
-----------------
Part A: Three presentation conditions (plain / XML / sandwich) on a clean dataset.
        You will record which conditions the model gets right and which it gets wrong.

Part B: Add near-miss distractors to lower the signal-to-noise ratio.
        The distractors are designed to look almost correct.

Part C: If Parts A and B showed no failures, switch to the small 8B model
        to find where format starts to matter.
        (Part C runs automatically if needed — you don't choose.)

THE HONEST CAVEAT
------------------
Strong frontier models on short, clean datasets sometimes get all three
conditions correct. That is not a failure of the experiment — it is data.
It tells you the signal-to-noise ratio is high enough that structural help
isn't needed here. Part B and Part C are designed to lower that ratio until
the effect appears, so you see it in practice, not just in lecture slides.

HOW TO RUN

#   The Bow Bar:       status = FULL
#   The Guilford Arms: vegan = NO
#   The Grain Store:   vegan = NO
#   The Hanging Bat:   capacity only 70
#   The Ensign Ewart:  capacity only 120
#
# The Albanach (capacity 180) satisfies all constraints but appears first.
# If the model has strong primacy bias it may return this — which is also
# technically acceptable. The QUESTION asks for "at least 160 guests."

#
# Two new venues placed directly before the correct answer:
#
#   The New Town Vault:  capacity 162 ✅  vegan NO  ❌  — capacity ok, wrong dietary
#   The Holyrood Arms:   capacity 160 ✅  vegan YES ✅  status FULL ❌
#
# The Holyrood Arms is the most dangerous: it satisfies capacity AND vegan,
# only failing on status. A model that skims rather than evaluating all three
# constraints will likely pick this one.
#
# Why place them immediately before the needle?
# Attention "blurs" adjacent similar items. The closer the distractor to the
# correct answer, the harder it is to discriminate between them.

#
# XML:      Each venue wrapped in its own tag with a numeric id.
