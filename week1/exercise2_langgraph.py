Exercise 2 — LangGraph Research Agent
======================================

WHAT YOU ARE DOING
-------------------
In this exercise you run the research agent you've started building in
sovereign_agent/agents/research_agent.py against the Edinburgh scenario.

The agent is already wired together (the LangGraph loop, the tools, the
LLM connection). Your job is to:

  Task A: Run it and observe the trace — which tools were called, in what order,
          and what decisions the model made between them.

  Task B: Run the flyer tool and observe its graceful-fallback pattern.
          The original version of this task asked you to implement a direct
          FLUX image call, but FLUX was removed from Nebius on 2026-04-13.
          The scaffold now ships with a working fallback implementation —
          see sovereign_agent/tools/venue_tools.py. Your job is to run it
          and record which path your run took (live or placeholder) in
          ex2_answers.py.

  Task C: Run three deliberate failure scenarios and observe how the agent handles
          each one. This is the most important part — how an agent handles the
          unexpected is what separates a prototype from something reliable.

  Task D: View the agent's internal graph structure and compare it to
          exercise3_rasa/data/flows.yml.

WHY THIS MATTERS FOR PYNANOCLAW
--------------------------------
research_agent.py is the autonomous-loop half of PyNanoClaw, the hybrid
system the final assignment will have you build. You extend it in the
Week 2 session (real web search + file operations) and again in the final
assignment (planner upstream, memory alongside, handoff bridge to the
Rasa half, observability). The trace structure you observe today
(Think → Tool Call → Observe → Repeat) is the same structure it will use
when PyNanoClaw is booking venues autonomously.

#
# The flyer tool now ships with a working graceful-fallback implementation.
# See sovereign_agent/tools/venue_tools.py → generate_event_flyer.
#
# It takes one of two paths:
#   (a) Live mode: if FLYER_IMAGE_MODEL is set in .env, it calls that model
#       and returns a real image URL.
#   (b) Placeholder mode: otherwise (or on any provider failure) it returns
#       a deterministic placehold.co URL with mode="placeholder".
#
# Both paths return success=True. Both are valid. Your job is to run the tool
# and record which path your run took in ex2_answers.py → TASK_B_MODE.
#
# This is a lesson in what "implementing a tool well" actually means in
# production: graceful degradation. A tool that raises on provider failure
# takes the entire ReAct loop down with it. A tool that returns a structured,
# labelled fallback keeps the agent's control flow intact.

# ─── Task C — three failure scenarios ─────────────────────────────────────────
#
# READ THE OUTPUT CAREFULLY for each scenario.
# An agent that handles failure gracefully is production-ready.
# One that crashes or makes things up is not.
#
# Scenario 1: First choice unavailable
#   The Bow Bar has status=full in VENUES. The agent should notice this
#   in the tool result and pivot to another venue without being told to.
#   Question: At which message did the pivot happen?
#
# Scenario 2: Impossible constraint
#   No venue in VENUES fits 300 people. The agent should admit this,
#   NOT make up a fictional venue.
#   Question: Did it hallucinate a venue name?
#
# Scenario 3: Completely out of scope
#   There is no tool for train times. The agent should handle this cleanly.
#   Question: Did it try to call a tool anyway? Did it make something up?

# They both describe "what the agent can do" — but very differently.
#
# Note: Task D builds its own agent purely to draw the graph. The graph
# structure doesn't depend on which model you use, but we still honour the
# RESEARCH_MODEL env var so your `make ex2-d` output is consistent with
# `make ex2-a` if you've pinned a non-default model.
